## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, try to save the world:

```java
public void saveTheWorld(Threat someThreat) {
    return myPowers.stream().anyMatch(p -> p.canOvercome(someThreat));
}
```
