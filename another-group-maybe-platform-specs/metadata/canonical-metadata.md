# Canonical Metadata

So here's some text I haven't "saved" yet. It's in a "draft".

$$
a = b - (1^(3-4))
$$

I'm editing. I'm doing some edits. This is really fun.

I'm doing some more edits. Wow this is incredible.

I've just done three edits. I wonder if this will create separate commits or something.

```text
this.edit = true;
```
